# Extrct_Mobilenumber_details
Mobile Number Tracker :
The Mobile Number Tracker is a Python script that allows you to validate and retrieve information about a mobile phone number, such as the country and carrier. 
Additionally, it demonstrates a mock function to simulate retrieving the associated name (note: this is just for demonstration purposes and should be replaced with a proper implementation in a real-world scenario).

Dependencies :
This project depends on the phonenumbers library, which is used for parsing and validating phone numbers. 
pip install phonenumbers

Usage:
1.Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mobile-number-tracker.git
cd mobile-number-tracker
2.Run the script:
python mobile_number_tracker.py

Acknowledgments:
The phonenumbers library is used for phone number parsing and validation. (More information about the library can be found https://github.com/daviddrysdale/python-phonenumbers.git)
